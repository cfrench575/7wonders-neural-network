ImageClassifier.ipynb (can be viewed here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cfrench575/7wonders-neural-network/blob/main/ImageClassifier.ipynb) trains a 4 layer neural network model created using fastai (pytorch).

The image classification model can recognize images of each of the 7 wonders of the modern world: 
  - Great Wall of China
  - Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro
  - Machu Picchu in Peru
  - Chichen Itza
  - Roman Colosseum
  - Taj Mahal in India
  - Petra in Jordan

Training data was collected using the Bing search API.
